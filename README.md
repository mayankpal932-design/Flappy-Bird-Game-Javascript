# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game (JavaScript)

A simple **Flappy Bird clone** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The game implements gravity-based movement, dynamic pipe generation, collision detection, and real-time score tracking using pure JavaScript DOM manipulation.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🕹 Bird jump control using keyboard input
- 🌍 Gravity-based movement system
- 🧱 Random pipe generation
- 💥 Collision detection using bounding rectangles
- 📊 Real-time score tracking
- 🛑 Game over screen
- 🔄 Restart game functionality
- ⚡ Smooth animation using JavaScript intervals

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
- Game Loop using `setInterval`
- Collision Detection using `getBoundingClientRect()`

---

## ⚙️ Game Logic

The game simulates physics using JavaScript intervals.  
Gravity continuously pulls the bird downward while keyboard input allows upward movement. Pipes are generated dynamically, and collision detection is handled by comparing element boundaries using `getBoundingClientRect()`.
